# Media Types

Deciding what content gets processed by gatsby-mdx. This is an
advanced option that is useful for dealing with specialized generated
content. It is not useful for most users. 

## Usage

```js
mediaTypes: ["text/markdown", "text/x-markdown"],
```

## Explanation

Gatsby includes the media-type of the content on any given node. For
`file` nodes, we choose whether to process the content with MDX or not
by the file extension. For remote content or generated content, we
choose which nodes to process by looking at the media type.
