# What’s MDX?

[MDX][mdx] is markdown for the component era.
It lets you write JSX embedded inside markdown.
It’s a great combination because it allows you to use markdown’s often terse
syntax (such as `# heading`) for the little things and JSX for more advanced
components.

This is useful in content-driven sites where you want the ability
to introduce components like charts or notifs without having to
configure a plugin. It emphasizes composition over configuration
and really shines with interactive blog posts, documenting design
systems, or long form articles with ambitious layouts.

## What does it look like in practice?

MDX might seem weird at first, but it quickly feels natural
after working with it for a few minutes. Importing and JSX
syntax works just like in your components. This results in a
seamless experience for developers and content authors alike.

```js
import { Chart } from '../components/chart'

# Here’s a chart

The chart is rendered inside our MDX document.

<Chart />
```

## Features

❤️ **Powerful**: MDX blends markdown and JSX syntax to fit perfectly in
React/JSX-based projects.

💻 **Everything is a component**: Use existing components inside your
MDX and import other MDX files as plain components.

🔧 **Customizable**: Decide which component is rendered for each markdown
element (`{ h1: MyHeading }`).

📚 **Markdown-based**: The simplicity and elegance of markdown remains,
you interleave JSX only when you want to.

🔥 **Blazingly blazing fast**: MDX has no runtime, all compilation occurs
during the build stage.
